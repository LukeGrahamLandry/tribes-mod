Eve, prophet of flora, taught mankind to be mindful of its surroundings. Just as beavers, birds, and many other animals harness the power of nature to build their homes and shape their environment, so too may humans do so; it is not a sin to destroy, so long as creation follows and destruction is kept to a minimum. We do not witness deer and wolves living in detestable fortresses or artificial forests of concrete, metal, and glass - neither should we dwell in them.

You may better your surroundings, but do not try to play God. If you are troubled by doubt, then consider this truth: if your plan requires the work of at least several men to achieve, then it most likely goes against nature. Build only what is reasonable and nothing more. Take only what you need and nothing else. If you destroy something, make use of every part of it. If you find yourself stockpiling resources and not using them, then you are not following Eve's teachings, received from holy Efba himself.

Many centuries after Eve rejoined the soil, Dasa, prophet of fauna, taught mankind to be mindful of its place in the food chain. Efba did not bless any creatures but mankind with the gift of intelligence. We Efbans are His chosen people, but we are also a part of nature. Just as carnivores and omnivores consume the flesh of other creatures, so too may humans do so, provided that they are allowed to roam freely, as is their natural right. Bears do not go about herding cattle and pigs into cages - nor shall we. You may protect and raise animals, but whatever holding pens or homes you make for them shall be no smaller than your own abode.

Being blessed with intelligence allows us to commit acts of good, yes, but also evil. Your fellow man will inevitably commit transgressions from time to time, as surely as you will too. Strive to forgive others, even should they name themselves your enemy; remember, they are, like you, only an animal, prone to all manner of mistakes and misjudgments. But do not roll over and submit without a fight. Should someone pose a serious threat to the well-being of others and possess the intent to cause great harm, then you must ask yourself, and act accordingly: what should be done with rabid animals..?
