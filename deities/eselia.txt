At times, it can be easy to lose sight of what really matters: the never-ending pursuit of pleasure. Within this tome are a number of activities, suggestions, and challenges to stimulate you - mind, body, and soul. May you find the happiness you seek.

Surviving on one's own
Contributing to a group effort
Building pathways to connect points of interest. You could take extra care to make them aesthetically pleasing, such as making mine cart systems that are reminiscent of roller coasters, canals that look like Roman aqueducts, etc.
Constructing interesting structures for others to discover and explore, such as cabins, partially buried stone ruins, or crypts
Drastically altering nature, such as creating a large, clearly artificial clearing in the middle of a vast forest, making your own lake complete with waterfalls, or leveling part of a mountain to create an easily traversable path through a mountain range
Building in an unlikely place, such as making a base underwater, high in the sky, or entirely underground. The ocean is another great area that doesn't see a lot of building. You could make a wooden shanty town at sea, a small artificial island, or countless other things
Making semi-automatic or fully automated machines of some kind, such as automated reed (or "sugar cane") farms, mob grinders, a door that opens automatically when you approach it, etc.
Picking something specific, such as statues or small buildings, and building them wherever you go to leave your mark on the world
Only performing one, specific task to the best of your ability as long as you can stand it, such as mining, fighting, building, food management (farming, fishing, and so on), inventory management, writing books, etc. Bonus points if you do it on an impressive, massive scale
Using a build prompt as inspiration to build something. Here are two examples: bit.ly/2NYvqG0

Keeping a daily diary and switching to new books as older ones are filled up
Writing lore for this world. Consider incorporating yourself, other people, and this world's deities into your lore
Writing horrifying stories. Consider incorporating elements of this world such as things you've built, people you've interacted with recently, and so on
Placing signs wherever you go
Drawing or taking pictures of events you've experienced in this world and sharing them with others
Trying out new texture packs or shaders
Creating a treasure hunt by leaving clues that lead people from place to place
Exploring for the sake of finding artificial structures, such as houses and bases. You could even organize pictures of the bases you find and share them with others
Raiding bases or other artificial structures you've found
Starting your own tribe, or inviting other people to the one you're already in

Inviting friends to play with you
Making your base more secure, especially from threats that you can't confront while you're offline, like enemy raiders
Watching a streaming video or listening to a podcast while doing things in-game
Trying out new mods
Doing something fun with explosives (without destroying anything that someone else built)
Hiding your base in plain sight, making it look like it's just another hill in the landscape, for example
Challenging yourself to do something you consider difficult, such as killing other people or a boss mob (like the ender dragon or a wither), or achieving a goal in a limited amount of time
Playing with a fear-based restriction, E.G. your character is afraid of water so they can't be around it, or your character has a fear of fire, or spiders, etc.
Infiltrating a tribe to report information about them to the tribe you're actually part of
Challenging other people to non-PvP competitions, like racing from one place to another, gambling, or seeing who can build a better-looking structure in under an hour. You could spice things up by betting on the outcome and inviting others to join in

Roleplaying. Quick and easy inspiration: friendly merchant, absolutely insane dwarf, intolerant paladin, self-proclaimed monarch of a country that no one's sure actually exists, overzealous priest, edgy swordsman, mysterious hermit, incompetent plague doctor, suspicious miner, charismatic pirate, dishonest journalist who's always asking for interviews, kleptomaniac lumberjack, enigmatic cryptid, clown for hire, negotiator who wants to achieve peace between two or more opposing tribes in this world, someone who's convinced that we're all living in a fictional world, flirtatious furry, police officer with a short temper, amateur comedian, or someone from another world (any canon character of your choice)

Challenging yourself NOT to do various things, such as:
Place or destroy blocks or entities at night
Jump when it's nighttime
Cause damage directly or indirectly (through the use of cacti, flint & steel, etc.) at night
Travel more than 50 blocks from wherever you happen to be whenever night falls
Move except by walking and jumping (no sprinting, boats, horses, teleportation, etc.) at night
Explore during the day
Use weapons other than your fists
Wear armor
Use any items that are superior to leather, copper, stone, or iron (your choice) tools/weapons/armor
Be rude to other people no matter what

Mine stone of any kind (including ore-bearing stone) nor receive it (including ores, ingots, and items manufactured from them) from other players, instead relying on explosions to harvest what you need
Strip mine, instead mining only exposed ores in cave systems and ravines and the like
Eat or drink so much that your hunger/thirst/both bars are ever over 50%, or 25% for added difficulty
Eat 4/5 (or 3/5 for the faint of heart) food groups of your choice, such as protein, vegetables, and so on
Benefit from machines such as automated crop farms, mob grinders, literal machines added by mods, and so forth. This includes not trading with people for resources that were gathered with the help of a machine
Leave the biome you've decided to build your base in (if you'd like, you may relocate your base one time before starting this challenge)
Remain aboveground for more than one day, then stay underground/underwater from that point forward
Destroy any naturally occurring blocks (aside from trees for wood) for as long as you can
Use any melee weapons
Or any other kind of challenge you can think of
