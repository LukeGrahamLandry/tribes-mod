1. He who is not with Us is against Us. In My name, convert or purge the heretic wherever you find him. Suffer not any degeneracy.
2. Harm not a fellow Julian in any way, neither physically nor verbally, financially nor psychologically, by sword or slander or seizure of property, excepting that he hath turned from My holy teachings. In such matters, attempt first to lead him back to Our righteous path. He who hath trod it before may yet tread it again.
3. The strong rule; the weak obey. This is the natural order of things. He who seeks to defy this order through subterfuge, falsehoods, intentional deceit by omission, bribery, blackmail, nepotism, seduction, or other cowardly means shall be put to the sword, fellow Julian or not.
4. There exist more liars than grains of sand; be not easily deceived. In all matters be diligent, demand both evidence and full context, and hold no Julian guilty unless all reasonable doubt hath been washed away. Skepticism and the pursuit of truth are second only to power.
5. You are man, not beast. Live as such. In all things, uphold honor.
6. He who strives not for greatness follows not My teachings. The means by which greatness may be achieved are many: understand that conquest, art, and mastering a trade are but a few. When ambition and inspiration elude you, you may seek counsel, you may study, or you may try harder; history records not those who give up.
7. It is no sin to relax or seek entertainment. You shall overwork neither yourself nor any other Julian. Separate reasonable workloads from unreasonable demands, recovery from fruitless recreation, and sloth from such matters as the pursuit of knowledge or muse.
