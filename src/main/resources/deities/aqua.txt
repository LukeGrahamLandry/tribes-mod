Aquans can get things done. Because you can get things done, even if they don't go well, it's not your fault! It's society's fault that things didn't work out!
You can run away from unpleasant things. That doesn't mean you've lost! Because, as they say, "Sometimes the only winning move is not to play!"
The path you choose after being in doubt is often one you'll regret, no matter what you choose. If you're going to regret your decision anyway, then do whatever's easiest for you in the moment!
Do not fear the future. Not even God knows whether you will be happy in the long run, so you should focus on being happy right now!
